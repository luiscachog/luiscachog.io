## Introduction

[Podman](http://podman.io/) is a daemonless, open-source, Linux native tool designed to make it easy to find, run, build, share and deploy applications using
Open Containers Initiative ([OCI](https://www.opencontainers.org/)) Containers and Container Images.

That been said, the core of podman only runs in Linux!
To use podman on macOS, we need to implement the **remote client** to manage container using a Linux as a backend.

### Brief Architecture

The remote client uses a client-server model.
We need Podman installed on a Linux VM that also has the SSH daemon running.
On our MacOS, when you execute a Podman command:

- Podman connects to the server via SSH.
- It then connects to the Podman service by using systemd socket activation.
- The Podman commands are executed on the Linux VM.
- From the client's point of view, it seems like Podman runs locally.

## Installation

### Install podman on MacOS

To install podman remote client on MacOS, we use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

<!-- markdownlint-disable commands-show-output -->
```shell
$ brew install podman
```
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

### Create a new ssh-keys on MacOS

We will need to connect via ssh to our vagrant VM, in order to do it passwordless, we will create a ssh-key, the commands for that are:

```shell
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "podman+vagrant"
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/<USERNAME>/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /Users/<USERNAME>/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/<USERNAME>/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:+pGx7Wcn9WdfRYKJrcdMiKEIPKFRW1lQ1MXP/8i0PLA podman+vagrant
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 4096]----+
|  ....=B+. ooo ..|
|   . ++. ..+oo.+ |
|    o  .. o +oo =|
|             .o+ |
|        S      ..|
|       . =  . . o|
|      . + .  B oo|
|       . o  E X o|
|        . .+.= o.|
+----[SHA256]-----+

cat /Users/<USERNAME>/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1y ... O3JH8w== podman+vagrant
```

### Create a vagrant VM

We will use a Virtual Machine based on [Fedora 33](https://getfedora.org/),

To create the specified Vagrantfile, we need to follow the next steps:

```shell
$ mkdir my-fedora && cd my-fedora

$ echo "Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "generic/fedora33"
  config.vm.hostname = "my-fedora"
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|
    v.memory = 1024
    v.cpus = 1
  end
end" >> Vagrantfile
```

## Implementation

At this moment we have:

- Podman installed
- A ssh-key with no password created
- A VM created with vagrant

Let's start our implementation

### Copy ssh-key from MacOS to Linux VM

We use the `ssh-copy-id` command, and it will ask us for the vagrant user password. The default one is: **vagrant**

```shell
$ ssh-copy-id -i id_rsa.pub vagrant@127.0.0.1 -p 2222

/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "id_rsa.pub"
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
vagrant@127.0.0.1's password:

Number of key(s) added:        1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh -p '2222' 'vagrant@127.0.0.1'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
```

You can verify connectivity with the command:

```shell
$ ssh vagrant@127.0.0.1 -p 2222
Last login: Tue Feb 23 07:33:45 2021 from 10.0.2.5
[vagrant@my-fedora ~]$
```

### Configure the Linux VM

On this step we will:

- Install the podman package and dependencies
- Enable the podman service
- Enable the sshd service

#### Installing podman

<!-- markdownlint-disable commands-show-output -->
```shell
sudo dnf --enablerepo=updates-testing install podman libvarlink-util libvarlink
```
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

#### Enableling the podman service

We can enable and start the service permanently, using the following commands:

<!-- markdownlint-disable commands-show-output -->
```shell
$ systemctl --user enable --now podman
```
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

Also, we will need to enable linger for this user in order for the socket to work when the user is not logged in.

<!-- markdownlint-disable commands-show-output -->
```shell
sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER
```
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

You can verify that the socket is listening with a simple Podman command.

<!-- markdownlint-disable commands-show-output -->
```shell
$ podman --remote info
```
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

#### Enableling the sshd service

In order for the client to communicate with the server you need to enable and start the SSH daemon on the Linux VM:

<!-- markdownlint-disable commands-show-output -->
```shell
$ sudo systemctl enable --now sshd
```
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

## Using the client

The first step in using the Podman remote client is to configure a **connection**. To do that, we need can add a connection by using the `podman system connection add` command.

<!-- markdownlint-disable commands-show-output -->
```shell
$ podman system connection add <CONNECTION-NAME> ssh://vagrant@127.0.0.1:2222 --identity <SSH-KEY>
$ podman system connection add my-fedora ssh://vagrant@127.0.0.1:2222 --identity ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

We can verify that the connection is in place with the command:

```shell
$ podman system connection list
Name       Identity                                                  URI
my-fedora*  ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub  ssh://vagrant@127.0.0.1:2222/run/user/1000/podman/podman.sock
```

Now we can test the connection with the command:

```shell
$ podman info
host:
  arch: amd64
  buildahVersion: 1.18.0
  cgroupManager: systemd
  cgroupVersion: v2
  conmon:
    package: conmon-2.0.21-3.fc33.x86_64
    path: /usr/bin/conmon
    version: 'conmon version 2.0.21, commit: 0f53fb68333bdead5fe4dc5175703e22cf9882ab'
  cpus: 1
  distribution:
    distribution: fedora
    version: "33"
  eventLogger: journald
  hostname: my-fedora
  ...
```

Also, you can start running podman commands as you run them in docker:

```shell
$ podman images
REPOSITORY  TAG     IMAGE ID      CREATED        SIZE
```

## Next steps

At this point we have installed everything that we need to start using podman on our MacOS, but podman only work if the Linux VM is up & running, otherwise you will receive an error similar to this:

```shell
$ podman images
Error: Cannot connect to the Podman socket, make sure there is a Podman REST API service running.: failed to create sshClient:
Connection to bastion host (ssh://vagrant@127.0.0.1:2222/run/user/1000/podman/podman.sock) failed.: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:2222: connect: connection refused
```

To avoid that behavior, what I implement is an automator workflow, here are the steps:

1. Get the vagrant VM id, to do that run:

    ```shell
    $ vagrant global-status
    id       name    provider   state    directory
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    894d683  my-fedora virtualbox running ~/vms/my-fedora

    The above shows information about all known Vagrant environments
    on this machine. This data is cached and may not be completely
    up-to-date (use "vagrant global-status --prune" to prune invalid
    entries). To interact with any of the machines, you can go to that
    directory and run Vagrant, or you can use the ID directly with
    Vagrant commands from any directory. For example:
    "vagrant destroy 1a2b3c4d"
    ```

    As you can see we are interested on get the id column, for this example: **894d683**

1. Now, we need to open **Automator**, go to *Launchpad -> search -> **type** automator*, do click on the **Automator** Application

    {{< figure src="posts/podman-macos-vagrant/launchpad-automator.png" caption="Launchpad + Automator" id="launchpad-automator" theme="ligth">}}

1. Then, we need to write an automator application, for this example I choose a workflow that it will run the command `vagrant up <VM-ID>`

    ```shell
    $ vagrant up 894d683
    Bringing machine 'my-fedora' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
    ==> default: Checking if box 'generic/fedora33' version '3.2.0' is up to date...
    ==> default: A newer version of the box 'generic/fedora33' for provider 'virtualbox' is
    ==> default: available! You currently have version '3.2.0'. The latest is version
    ==> default: '3.2.6'. Run `vagrant box update` to update.
    ==> default: Clearing any previously set forwarded ports...
    ==> default: Clearing any previously set network interfaces...
    ==> default: Preparing network interfaces based on configuration...
        default: Adapter 1: nat
    ==> default: Forwarding ports...
        default: 22 (guest) => 2222 (host) (adapter 1)
    ==> default: Running 'pre-boot' VM customizations...
    ==> default: Booting VM...
    ==> default: Waiting for machine to boot. This may take a few minutes...
        default: SSH address: 127.0.0.1:2222
        default: SSH username: vagrant
        default: SSH auth method: private key
    ==> default: Machine booted and ready!
    ==> default: Checking for guest additions in VM...
    ==> default: Setting hostname...
    ==> default: Machine already provisioned. Run `vagrant provision` or use the `--provision`
    ==> default: flag to force provisioning. Provisioners marked to run always will still run.
    ```

    {{< figure src="posts/podman-macos-vagrant/automator-workflow.png" caption="Automator Workflow" id="automator-workflow" theme="ligth">}}

1. Save the Workflow and remember the location where you save it.

1. The final step is to add the workflow to our **login items**. Go to `Systems Preferences -> Users & Groups -> Login Items` and add the application that you save on the previous step.

    {{< figure src="posts/podman-macos-vagrant/login-items.png" caption="Login Items Menu" id="login-items" theme="ligth">}}

    And that is all, you will have a fully working podman command on your MacOS.
