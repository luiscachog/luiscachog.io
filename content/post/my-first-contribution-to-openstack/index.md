I been working since last year using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) for fun and to trying to get prepared to become a DevOps, so I found an excelent OpenStack project called [ARA Records Ansible](https://github.com/openstack/ara).

{{< figure src="posts/my-first-contribution-to-openstack/Ansible-Logo.png" caption="Ansible Logo" id="ansible-logo" theme="ligth">}}

Basically it  is a project from the OpenStack community that makes it easier to understand and troubleshoot your Ansible roles and playbooks.
If you want more information, please refer to the [Documentation Page](http://ara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Anyhow, I just found a little bug on the Ansible Role to install ARA [ansible-role-ara](https://opendev.org/recordsansible/ansible-role-ara) on Debian based distros and just send the patch to fix it.

Here is the link to my [contribution](https://opendev.org/recordsansible/ansible-role-ara/commit/3e194e169070213c0bcfd007c97222ce318c6556).

And, as I am proud of my first commit on a big project here is the screenshot too:

I feel happy and motivated to still learn about this Open-Source project and a lot more.
