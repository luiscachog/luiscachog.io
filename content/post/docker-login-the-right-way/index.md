# Docker Login the right Way

Hi again!

It is been a while since I wrote something here, as always, there is no much time for a hobby.

I've been working for a while with docker, not a production level, but for some applications that I use at work.
And since the [Docker Hub Data breach](https://www.zdnet.com/article/docker-hub-hack-exposed-data-of-190000-users/)
I put more atention on the security of my data/credentials, so I investigate a little about and found this official
repository [https://github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers/](https://github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers/) from Docker where are the supported credential helpers.

## Credential Store

Docker keeps our credentials saved on a JSON file located on ```~/.docker/config.json```,
but unfortunatelly credentials are just encrypted on base64,
here is an [articule/video](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/base64_not_encryption/) where there is an explanation for the why it is a bad idea to just use base64 encryption.

The following is a diagram on how a plain text storage works:

{{< figure src="posts/docker-login-the-right-way/DockerPlainTextCredentials.png" caption="Plain Text Storage" id="docker-plain-text-storage" theme="ligth">}}

Here is an example on how ```~/.docker/config.json``` looks like when is using plain text credentials:

```shell
cat ~/.docker/config.json
{
  "auths": {
    "https://index.docker.io/v1/": {
      "auth": "azRjaDA6c3VwZXJzZWNyZXRwYXNzd29yZAo="
    },
    "quay.io": {
      "auth": "azRjaDA6c3VwZXJzZWNyZXRwYXNzd29yZAo="
    }
  },
  "HttpHeaders": {
    "User-Agent": "Docker-Client/18.09.6 (linux)"
  }
}
```

After a successful ```docker login``` command,
Docker stores a base64 encoded string from the concatenation of the username, a colon, and the password and associates this string to the registry the user is logging into:

```shell
$ echo azRjaDA6c3VwZXJzZWNyZXRwYXNzd29yZAo= | base64 -d -
luiscachog:supersecretpassword
```

A ```docker logout``` command removes the entry from the JSON file for the given registry:

```shell
$ docker logout quay.io
Remove login credentials for quay.io

$ cat ~/.docker/config.json
{
  "auths": {
    "https://index.docker.io/v1/": {
      "auth": "azRjaDA6c3VwZXJzZWNyZXRwYXNzd29yZAo="
    }
  },
  "HttpHeaders": {
    "User-Agent": "Docker-Client/18.09.6 (linux)"
  }
}
```

## Docker Credential Helpers

Since docker version `1.11` implements support from an external credential store for registry authentication.
That means we can use a native keychain of the OS. Using an external store is more secure than storing on a "plain text" Docker configuration file.

{{< figure src="posts/docker-login-the-right-way/DockerSecureCredentials.png" caption="Secure Storage" id="docker-secure-storage" theme="ligth">}}

In order to use a external credential store, we need a program to interact with.

The actual list of "official" Docker Credential Helper is:

1. docker-credential-osxkeychain: Provides a helper to use the OS X keychain as credentials store.
2. docker-credential-secretservice: Provides a helper to use the D-Bus secret service as credentials store.
3. docker-credential-wincred: Provides a helper to use Windows credentials manager as store.
4. docker-credential-pass: Provides a helper to use pass as credentials store.

## docker-credential-secret service

On this post we will explore the docker-credential-secretservice and how to configure it.

1. We need to download and install the helper.
You can find the lastest release on  [https://github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers/releases](https://github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers/releases).
Download it, extract it and make it executable.

    ```shell
    wget https://github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers/releases/download/v0.6.2/docker-credential-secretservice-v0.6.2-amd64.tar.gz
    tar -xf docker-credential-secretservice-v0.6.2-amd64.tar.gz
    chmod +x docker-credential-secretservice
    sudo mv docker-credential-secretservice /usr/local/bin/
    ```

1. Then, we need to specify the credential store in the file ```~/.docker/config.json``` to tell docker to use it.
The value must be the one after the prefix ```docker-credential-```. In this case:

    ```json
    {
      "credsStore": "secretservice"
    }
    ```

    To facilite the configuration and do not make mistakes, you can run:

    ```shell
    sed -i '0,/{/s/{/{\n\t"credsStore": "secretservice",/' ~/.docker/config.json
    ```

From now we are uning an external store, so if you are currently logged in, you must run ```docker logout``` to remove the credentials from the file and run ```docker login``` tostart using the new ones.

Let me know how this works for you.
