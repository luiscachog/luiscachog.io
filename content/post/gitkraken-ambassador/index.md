Hello again,

I'm happy to announce that I'm participating in the **[GitKraken Ambassador program](https://www.gitkraken.com/ambassador)**.

For me, it is a joy that the GitKraken team trusts me for this work.

## GitKraken Ambassador

I have been a [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) advocate even before they launched this program.
I always recommend it to all my friends and colleges because I have loved it since the first time I used it, back in 2018.

Now, I'm being named Ambassador to actively promote it in community events, meetings with other Ambassadors, beta-testing of new functionality, etc.
Also, I will create some post showing/explaining how I use GitKraken in my job, that is A LOT.

For joining the GitKraken Ambassador team, I received:

- Free GitKraken Pro Account ($79 value)
- Ambassador Starter Kit: Stickers, Swag & Resources
- Access to a private Ambassador Slack Channel
- Exclusive Ambassador Content & early access to beta features
- Access to GitKraken Product Team to share feedback and get exclusive insight

## What is GitKraken?

Let's start defining what is GitKraken for me and how I use it.

GitKraken provides me the easiest, safest, and most powerful way to interact/work with:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/),
- and more Source Code Management (VCS)

becoming the best complement to manage your source code.

As an Infrastructure consultant, I contribute to Ansible playbooks/roles, Terraform provisioning, Kubernetes/OpenShift manifests, Documentation, and more, but my profile is not necessary as a `Developer`.
I consider myself more a `DevOps Practitioner` where, from my perspective, I write code for Infrastructure in a declarative way; that being said, my workflow is slightly different from a `Developer`.

That means I usually do all my code in VSCode. Sometimes I commit using the terminal and sometimes using the Kraken.
Once I'm ready to push my changes, I switch to GitKraken to review that I'm in the correct branch/tree/tag, if there are no conflicts, etc. and,
then I do push/merge it in a collaborative way and keeping the order that the project requires and that I want to show.
That personal workflow always helped me to avoid mistakes in my job.

### What I like

- GitKraken has a pretty neat interface where it is easy to find all I need for that git workflow.

- Multiple git profiles support

  {{< figure src="posts/gitkraken-ambassador/gitkraken-profiles.gif" caption="GitKraken Profiles 2/2" id="gitkraken-profile-2" theme="light">}}

- Easy drag and drop Pull-Request/Merge-Request integration

  {{< figure src="posts/gitkraken-ambassador/gitkraken-pull-request.gif" caption="GitKraken Drag & Drop Pull Request" id="gitkraken-pr" theme="light">}}

### What I don't like

- Sometimes, when my computer has high resources usage, like when I'm running some containers/virtual machines, GitKraken produces a slow down for a bit like some other GUI's.

## Wrapping Up

So, starting today, I'm going to generate content related to Git/Gitkraken, and to achieve this, I will write about how I integrate GitKraken into my daily work.

If you want to start using GitKraken, you can [download the Kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/download) and try it by yourself!
Furthermore, I recommend to use [my referral code](https://www.gitkraken.com/invite/kkvpJVykg) when you sign in.

Happy coding!
