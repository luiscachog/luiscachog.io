## Using the Ansible stat module on a loop

Hi again, it's been a while since I wrote something on this blog.
This time I was working on a Ansible playbook and I get this:

### Problem

I want to verify if a file exists. Depending on the registered output I want to perform some other actions.
On my specific use case, I want to use in in conjunct with the `file` module to define the state on my next task.

```mermaid
graph TD;
A(Stat over file) --> B{Does the file exists?};
B -->|Yes| C[state: file];
B -->|No| D[state: touch];
```

### Solution

Here is the solution that worked for me, using `loops`, `loop_control`,and `jinja2` filters.

```yaml
- name: Stat over the files
  stat:
    path: "{{ my_loop }}"
    loop:
      - /etc/cron.allow
      - /etc/at.allow
    loop_control:
      loop_var: my_loop
    register: my_stat_var

- name: Create a file if not exists
  file:
    path: "{{ item.my_loop }}"
    owner: root
    group: root
    mode: og-rwx
    state: "{{ 'file' if item.stat.exists else 'touch' }}"
  loop: "{{ my_stat_var.results }}"
```

Basically, I'm using the new `loop` [syntax](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_loops.html) to iterate over all the files that I want to check.

In order to avoid some warnings about the loop using `item` I implement the `loop_control` and `loop_var` syntax to control the loop behavior and on this specific case,
instead of using the word `item` I will substitute it with the one that I define as my `loop_var` in this case is called `my_loop` (Remember this, I will use it on the next task).

I'm registering the result of the stat task on a variable, for this case is `my_stat_var`

Here is an example of the output, when the 2 files **do not exists:**

```json
ok: [instance-amazon2] => {
    "my_loop": {
        "changed": false,
        "msg": "All items completed",
        "results": [
            {
                "ansible_loop_var": "my_loop",
                "at_cron_restricted_touch": "/etc/cron.allow",
                "changed": false,
                "failed": false,
                "invocation": {
                    "module_args": {
                        "checksum_algorithm": "sha1",
                        "follow": false,
                        "get_attributes": true,
                        "get_checksum": true,
                        "get_md5": false,
                        "get_mime": true,
                        "path": "/etc/cron.allow"
                    }
                },
                "stat": {
                    "exists": false
                }
            },
            {
                "ansible_loop_var": "my_loop",
                "at_cron_restricted_touch": "/etc/at.allow",
                "changed": false,
                "failed": false,
                "invocation": {
                    "module_args": {
                        "checksum_algorithm": "sha1",
                        "follow": false,
                        "get_attributes": true,
                        "get_checksum": true,
                        "get_md5": false,
                        "get_mime": true,
                        "path": "/etc/at.allow"
                    }
                },
                "stat": {
                    "exists": false
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

On the next task I access the results of the registered variable `my_stat_var` using, according to the previous output,
I need to use the `results` variable to access it and gives me 2 arrays (each one for each file)

Also, I extract the `path` from the same variable `my_stat_var.results` **but** as it is part of a loop,
I will access it using `item.my_loop` as on the the second task loop I'm not using a `loop_control`,
also I can access it using `item.item` but I prefer the first syntax.
In case you implement a `loop_control` on you can access it as `my_second_loop.my_loop`

Also, I extract if the file exists with the variable `item.stat.exists` **but** I'm putting that on a `jinja2` filter, that way it will evaluate and set the correct option on the `state`

```yaml
# When the file exists
state: file
# When the file does not exists
state: touch
```

This behavior also brings idempotency to your task, because:

- If the files does not exists on the first iteration it will be created and,
- The next time you run the tasks as the files already exists it will works as a `stat` and will return the current state of `path`.

That is all for now. See you soon!
