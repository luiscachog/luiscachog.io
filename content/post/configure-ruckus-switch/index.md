I just have a Ruckus ICX 7150 Switch on my home and I'm trying to get access under ssh and web, to easy configuration and security instead of use telnet.
So, I logged in using telnet and then run the following commands to configure a username/password and begin to receive petitions over port 22(ssh) and port 443(https).
Let's begin!

1. We will connect via telnet to the switch.

    ```shell
    telnet SWITCH_IP
    ```

1. Once we are on the Switch CLI as a optional step, we can configure an IP on the switch.

    ```shell
    device> enable
    device# configure terminal
    device(config)# ip address IP_ADDRESS/CIDR
    device(config)# ip default-gateway IP_GATEWAY
    ```

1. Now, the next steps are for generate a SSL certificate, a username/password, activate password to login and enable thw web access and ssh access.

    ```shell
    device(config)# crypto-ssl certificate generate
    device(config)# username USERNAME password PASSWORD
    device(config)# aaa authentication login default local
    device(config)# aaa authentication web-server default local
    ```

1. It may take several minutes to generate the certificate key. After that, save the configuration.

    ```shell
    device(config)# write memory
    ```

Now you are able to login on your switch using ssh or web.
