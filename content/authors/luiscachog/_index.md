## $ whoami

I'm a proud father of Emma, dedicated husband of [Ale](https://twitter.com/4l381), avid soccer fanatic, beer lover, and fond of all things GNU/Linux related.

Currently working as a **Senior Container Infrastructure Consultant** at **[Red Hat](https://redhat.com/)** helping customer with their Cloud Native projects, focused on OpenShift migrations.
Prior to Red Hat I worked on [Rackspace](https://www.rackspace.com) and [Mexican Stock Exchange (BMV)](https://www.bmv.com.mx/).

As today I consider myself a Technologist. I have become knowledgeable in many areas of systems, cloud computing, and various other fields like:

- Linux Servers
- Cloud Computing
- Operating Systems
- IaC (Infrastructure as Code)
- Networking
- Cloud Native technologies

Actively contributing to [Open Source projects]({{< relref "/open-source#projects" >}}) as well as learn new stuff every day and I would try to share in this blog.

I enjoy attend meetups and events to learn about new technologies, talk with interesting people and exchange stickers.

I’m active on LinkedIn and Github, and occasionally on Twitter.
