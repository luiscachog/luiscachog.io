I been working since last year using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) for fun and to trying to get prepared to become a DevOps, so I found an excelent OpenStack project called [ARA Records Ansible](https://github.com/openstack/ara).

Basically it  is a project from the OpenStack community that makes it easier to understand and troubleshoot your Ansible roles and playbooks.  
If you want more information, please refer to the [Documentation Page](http://ara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  

Anyhow, I just found a little bug on the Ansible Role to install ARA [ansible-role-ara](https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/ansible-role-ara/) on Debian based distros and just send the patch to fixit.  

Here is the link to my [contribution](https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/ansible-role-ara/commit/).  

And, as I am proud of my first commit on a big project here is the screenshot too:

I feel happy and motivated to still learn about this Open Source project and a lot more.
